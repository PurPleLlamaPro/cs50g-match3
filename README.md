## Requirements
Match3 was built using the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) engine.

[Push](https://github.com/Ulydev/push) was used for resolution-handling, [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump/blob/master/class.lua) was used for Lua object-orientation, and [Knife](https://github.com/airstruck/knife) was used to handle asynchronous code, chained functions, and tweening.
